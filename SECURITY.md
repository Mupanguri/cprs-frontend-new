# CPRS Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This section outlines the versions of our project that are currently receiving security updates. We actively monitor and address security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | End of Life Date |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 19.1.   | :React:            | Ongoing          |
| 5.0.   | :npm:                | [YYYY-MM-DD]     |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: | [YYYY-MM-DD]     |
| < 4.0   | :x:                | [YYYY-MM-DD]     |

**Important Notes:**

* We strongly recommend that users stay updated to a supported version to ensure they receive the latest security patches.
* Versions marked with :x: are no longer supported and will not receive any further security updates. Continuing to use unsupported versions may expose you to known vulnerabilities.
* The "End of Life Date" indicates the date after which a version will no longer receive any updates, including security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate you reporting it to us responsibly. Please follow these guidelines:

    * The specific version(s) of the project affected.
    * A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
    * Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    * Potential impact of the vulnerability.
    * Any suggested fixes or mitigation strategies (if known).

**What to Expect After Reporting:**

1.  **Acknowledgement:** You will receive an acknowledgement of your report within [number] business days. This confirms that we have received your submission and are reviewing it.
